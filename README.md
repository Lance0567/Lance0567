👋 Hi there, I’m Lance Esurena!
I’m a passionate developer, hardware innovator, and researcher who loves bringing ideas to life through code and electronics.
Currently exploring how software and hardware can work together — from developing Delphi applications and web systems, to building Arduino- and Raspberry Pi-powered prototypes.

🚀 What I Do
🧩 Software Development:
* Building modern systems using Delphi VCL, FMX, and web technologies (HTML, Tailwind, and JavaScript frameworks).
⚙️ Hardware Prototyping:
- Designing and coding automated machines, sensor-based systems, and IoT devices using Arduino, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi.
🧠 Research & Innovation:
Creator of the Advanced Automated Collating and Stapling Mechanism for Office Efficiency, a university research project combining electronics and automation for real-world applications.

🌱 Currently Learning
Full-stack web development
Advanced Delphi database integration with MySQL, SQLite and Oracle APEX
AI and machine learning for automation and data-driven systems
