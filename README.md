# 👨‍💻 Who?
Hi! I'm **Lance Esurena** a developer, researcher, and hardware innovator from the Philippines 🇵🇭.  
I love building things that merge **software and hardware** from web apps and database systems to Arduino-powered machines and IoT prototypes.  

Professionally, I work with **Delphi**, **MySQL**, and **Automations**, but personally I love experimenting with **Arduino**, **Raspberry Pi**, and **ESP32** to bring my automation ideas to life.

# 🔭 What I’m Exploring
Always mixing tools from classic frameworks to cutting-edge tech to build the most efficient setup for every project.  

**Current Stack & Tools:**
- 💻 **Software Dev:** Delphi (VCL & FMX), HTML, CSS, Tailwind, JavaScript  
- 🧠 **Database:** MySQL, SQLite, Oracle APEX  
- ⚙️ **Hardware / IoT:** Arduino Uno, Mega, ESP32, Raspberry Pi 4  
- 🔌 **Prototyping Tools:** Blynk, Sensor Shield, Stepper & DC Motor Drivers, I2C LCDs  
- 🧩 **Others:** Git, TablePlus, Figma, VS Code, Embarcadero RAD Studio
